It was also that '70s era polyester type material and was duller and more peachy than the picture. I could barely squeeze it over my hips and it showed EVERYTHING (I could see my belly button), but you can't wear any ""slim-wear"" because of the open back. It's also very short, but I do have long legs. The perfect body for this is under 5'5"", no hips and no fat on your stomach. If that's not you, then size up, maybe twice... Or rethink your selection.

Regarding size, it runs true, but if you’re like me and have a bigger bust for your size, I recommend sizing up for backup and if not, size down so it’s more form fitting to your body.

And the rose gold was very unique and let me stand out from all yellow gold at the gold-themed event.  The neckline was conservative, yet very flattering.  I was a volunteer at the event so I was all over the place and had the confidence that my dress would not let me down. I comfortably wore a strapless bra, but I think you could get away with even wearing a standard bra.  I also wore a slimmer underneath to ensure everything was ""flat and smooth"" and the dress hid it perfectly.  
 
Cons:  Even though it was a Long, the front of the dress hit 3 inches above the floor without heels and the slight train hit at the floor with my 2 in heels.  The liner of the dress fit a bit longer than the sequin outer layer so I had to be conscious of that and check that it wasn't peeking out the front.  Also, the hook & eye at the back of the neck would not stay closed, no matter how many times I tried.  Thankfully, it did not leave me inappropriate when it came undone, but was still a nuisance.

Fair warning: this dress hiked pretty far up my legs when I sat down, so if you have a lot of weight in your thighs you might not be able to move much as most of the volume is in the hips. I will also say the dress pinches the fat between your chest and arms, but maintaining perfect posture corrects most of it. That said, I still give the dress a five-star rating.

The next morning, my thighs still hurt and were irritated.  Had this been my own dress, I would have cut out the plastic part of the dress.

I'm self-conscious, tending to wear A-line dresses, but took a chance on this dress after reading reviews and looking at  pictures. Glad I did! As other reviews have commented: the sequins do scratch your underarms. I wore my dress for 9+ hours and my arms had lots of tiny scratches visible the next morning. But there really wasn't any discomfort involved while wearing the dress. My advice with the zipper: Be patient, breathe, and call a friend if necessary. The first time I tried the dress on I couldn't get the zipper to budge the last 4 inches. I put the dress on an hour later and the zipper went right up. I did not have an issue with the liner coming up over the neckline. I chose not to wear a bra at all because when I bent forward you could see my strapless bra down the middle. I lost a little ""perkiness"" without the bra but no one noticed and I felt more comfortable. My one complaint is actually that I stepped on the train more than anything. I walk with confidence and purpose in heels and the train kept getting whipped underneath my feet. The straps were a tiny bit roomy but didn't fall or slouch. The dress feels heavy on the hanger but is easy to wear all night long. I wore the 8R (the 6R wouldn't fit at all) and it was a bit tight going over my hips.. I wore 2-2.5 inch heels and wouldn't have gone any higher. If I'd had 3+ inch heels I'd probably have needed the 8L.

It's not at risk of showing anything, it just adds a bit of va va voom to an otherwise classic shape, and you need to know whether that's what you are looking for 2) One of the fabrics is a bit shiny, so again, it is not bad, but it certainly gives the dress a kind of 'look' that is harder to see in some of the photos.

Now, for some small, mostly nit-picky observations and complaints that may help others decide on dresses.  Between the 8L and the 10L, either probably could have worked, though I thought the 10L fit my bust a bit better and that zipper was easier to get up (coincidence or fit, I'm not sure - zippers and lace are always a bit tough).  Like many have said, it is really low cut, so be ready for that!  I felt like the smaller size seemed to expose me more than the larger.  For some reason, the neckline kept everting a bit on the left so the lace would fold down and a bit of the lining would show which was mildly annoying to keep adjusting (you can see this in the photo).  It has a built in bra that's not terribly supportive and I felt like it actually flattened my bust more than anything, so I ended up wearing a strapless bra with it to combat that.  The long was indeed long - I wore 4 inch heels and was still stepping on the hemline if I didn't hold it up.

I wore a very low heel but if I was in 3 inch heels or higher I would have gone with the Long length because I'm 5'7"".  Also, I didn't wear a bra because the sequins and fabric are thick enough but if you have a larger chest, I would say a sticky bra would do the trick.

Regarding length, I have the same issue with all gowns I've rented from RTR - to go L or R with a size! I'm 5'7"", and the 4R fell 1.5 inches above the ground when I wore 3"" heels. The 2L fell perfectly, just hitting the ground, when I wore 5"" heels. Definitely be conscientious of the length here- I suggest being prepared with different height heels, depending of whether you rent an L or an R size! Other than length, the dress was perfection. I rented this as a bridesmaid for a wedding. I did not have to wear a bra, because the dress fit snugly over my chest. I felt comfortable all night! My ONE COMPLAINT - and this is a complaint I've had in the past with RTR - the lining of the gown fell below the hem!  I've found this happens when a dress is overly dry-cleaned; the material of the dress itself shrinks a bit overtime, while the lining and/or slip stretches. RTR, you need to do a better job of taking care of this issue in between rentals!! I had to use double-sided tape to bring the lining up inside the dress.

The black cheetah print on the navy adds interest and depth to the dress while the silver  poppy silhouettes on the bottom make it stand out.

The dress sizing is fairly true to size. I fell in between a size 10 and 12 and ultimately wore the 12. The size 10 was snug around my ribs and chest so it didn't lay as nicely. The size 12 was slightly big in the shoulders but it worked fine. The skirt had more volume on me than it appears to have on the model but I didn't mind the flirty shape to gave.

An issue I had with the dress was that the size 12 arrived with the front hem having fallen out. I was able to quickly ""repair"" with some hem tape but I hope the RTR team fixes the issue before it is sent out again.

I ended up with the 6L because the 6R became unavailable. In the end it worked out great I think; I wore 5"" platform sandals underneath and I actually liked the fabric draping down and behind like a mini-train. It was a beautiful effect. 
The dress has light boning in the bodice. It was tight but very comfortable; kept everything in place. I didn't have to wear anything underneath. The decolletage does have some lace that needs to be secured with fashion tape or else it will flop down. I used a little and it did the trick just fine. The skirt was form-fitting but very comfortable. Some people commented it can bunch up underneath and this is true, but very easily fixed. There are actually 4 layers of skirt: under layer which is like a comfortable rayon material in a nude neutral color, two layers of thin black tulle, and the black lace overlay with floral applique. You need to hoist the skirt up to your waist once you have the dress on, then smooth each layer down to the floor one by one. This takes care of the bunching up problem and you're good to go all night! The skirt is form-fitting but quite comfortable; easy to sit in and dance in. 
What I loved the most was the dress was even more beautiful in person. The lace applique are actually with a very pale pink and green color mixed in with the silvery-white, and some very light sequins is clustered around that catches the light just perfectly without being obvious. It reminds me very much of how a mother-of-pearl sort of changes color and shines as the light hits it from different angles. It was spectacular in person and I got a thousand compliments all night.

At 5'5"" this was at mid-thigh for me.  Because this is two pieces, you can actually wear the top separately from the dress beneath, which is a fun option and looks amazing with a pair of white jeans.

I'm nice and squishy in all the right places (and also in some places I wish weren't so squishy).  I would say I'm on average a size 6 - but depending on the make I can be anywhere from a 2 to a 10.  (don't you HATE women's sizing.?)   I ordered a size 4 based on the reviews of other women my size/hight/weight, and a 6 as a backup.  The 4 fit great - but as others have said, the arm holes were very tight so I couldn't zip or unzip on my own.  Since I was attending an event alone, and my husband wouldn't be home to help me out before hand, I went with the 6, which I could zip up myself.  The lace hem of the dress came just above my knees - a good length. It didn't ride up on me, and was very comfortable. The dress I wore had some obvious repairs to the under-arms because the lace must have ripped (remember, the tight arm holes?) - but it was nothing anyone would have noticed unless they had their face up in my armpit, which wasn't likely to happen.  I got lots of compliments on the dress, and my husband, especially, loved it. First time renting with RTR.  I live in New England - ordered the dress on a Tuesday, and it arrived on Wednesday morning for my Thursday event!  Put everything back in the packaging it came in and dropped it off at my local UPS store.  Easy Peasy.  Will definitely be renting again with RTR.

The round neckline does not come up very high, so pair it with either a high necked blouse or a collared shirt - both will peek out nicely.

The only issue I had was the fit. It was difficult to tell via reviews if I needed a medium or a large because people around my side went for both. I went with Medium and there was no large for a back up, so I had to cross my fingers. The skirt was a little too small in the natural waist (where it hit) and so I had to leave it unzipped about a half an inch.

Although it was nice that it was fully-lined, the dress was a little heavy for a hot summer day. I was sweating on/off most of the day and none of the perspiration appeared on the dress. The dress has pockets which is awesome but they sat a little far back which made them kind of awkward and seemed to make the dress puff out a bit.

Along with the heavy fabric, it had zero stretch. It was very difficult to sit in the car and at my dinner table. The sleeves made it difficult to put my hands/arms up while dancing (which we did a lot because it was a Bosnian wedding!). The neckline was also a little tight and constricted my neck when bending over.

Overall it is a nice structured dress that I would recommend for an event with little movement. I probably would not rent this dress again.

The dress is styled so that even though these are low, they aren't distracting.  If  you don't want lines or cup peaking through, strapless cups were a must.  I tried a strapless bra and the cups didn't show, but the lines from the bra were very apparent.  Even the lines from spanx were apparent so I wasn't able to wear those either.  The biggest difference between the medium and large was the shoulder to waist ratio and overall length, so I went with medium so that the cut outs hit where they were supposed to.

LENGTH: Hit just above the knee (I'm 5'2) so definitely longer for petite girls than on the model. I think it balances the low cut of the top though so I prefer that it isn't mid-thigh.

FIT: True to size. Didn't notice the tightness in the ribcage, but I'm smaller in that area. It was tight in the bust but I've got a large chest (32DD). Definitely gives enough support to be worn without a bra (even for naturally large breasts, like mine, that are obviously more prone to gravity than augmented ones). Made ""the girls"" look fantastic and almost fake (see the group picture) but I did have to keep adjusting and tucking them in throughout the night. In hindsight, wish I purchased It Stays body adhesive to keep everything in place. 

CUT: You will have cleavage and tons of it - but if you read the reviews, you already know this. Again, body adhesive would have been helpful (not Hollywood tape since anyone with large breasts knows that is no where near strong enough to hold things in!). Fullness of the skirt is forgiving if you're eating/drinking a lot. Also the pockets are obviously awesome and super convenient. 

OVERALL: Gave 4 stars due to the tight fit on the bust and feeling like there wasn't quite enough fabric to cover me completely without my breasts popping out a bit.

I have a pretty petite upper body (32A/B, size 0 and sometimes 00), but athletic thighs (size 2 on the bottom). I wore the size 0 because it fit my upper body well and I didn't want the top shifting around or exposing anything (I didn't wear any kind of bra). However the size 0 was pretty tight on my legs and I felt a little inappropriate wearing a dress that tight/short to a wedding. I wish I could have had the fit from the size 0 on top and the size 2 for my legs.

Dress fits extremely tight up at the bust and at the waist seam. I'm a 34A-maybe a small 32B bust with a 28"" waist. Dress looks like you can wear a strapless bra but bust area is very tight/flattening so I had to wear the Victoria's secret adhesive petals which worked perfect.

Pros: 
-Nice faggoting detail at armhole/waist-shows a little skin but still appropriate for wedding/formal
-Nice colors/print
-Nice length-I'm short 5'4"" and wear usually flat/low heel shoes. Dress was long enough to be formal but I wasn't tripping over it. It hit me between the ankle and the calf.  Handkerchief hem was cute too. 
Cons: 
-Fabric wrinkles easily :( and has some static cling
-Skirt lining was a little short/tight.  I think the lining should have been slightly fuller for a full skirt

I didn't find much difference between the fit of the 6 and 8.

The structure of the bodice is really helpful in going braless, though, and fit me like a glove, which made me confident. The slip underneath leaves a little to be desired - it was sheer, and was definitely too snug on my pear frame, causing it to ride up and make wrinkles in the outer layer at times.

I can only find one in the world for sale, two sizes too big, but might just go ahead and purchase anyway and alter it down, at whatever cost.

I usually wear a 6 in dresses, but luckily I got a backup size in an 8 - because the 6 was wayyy too stretched in the hip region.  

The lace in the back is beautiful - the slits are sexy - and the dress twirls beautifully on the dance floor.  It looks conservative when you're standing still - but then you walk... and the legs are on the display - so just beware, but it's not as scandalous as you might think.  Only negative is the cap sleeves make it a tad uncomfortable to put your hands in the air - but that's only a problem if you're a crazy dancer! ;)

The small details of this dress definitely made it for me. Especially those sleeves.

Two things of note: I found the black strip at the bottom of the cutout in the back to resemble the back of a bra from faraway. This is one of the reasons that I paired it with a black button-down. 

two: the hook/eye on the back came undone MULTIPLE times during the day as I wore this. Forgivable since the dress is so beautiful, but maybe check to make sure yours' is pinched better than mine clearly was...

The little touch of magenta from the berry print is nice too. The top goes well with a lot of different bottoms; in the photo I paired it with RTR's Badgley Mischka Windswept skirt for a date at the Whitney museum, but on other occasions wore it with a plain white skirt / white jeans to dinner with friends. The white jeans I own are low-cut, which led to a little more midriff exposure than I'm comfortable with so in the future I would pair it with high-waisted jeans. The only thing I would want to change about this top is to make the cut a tad less boxy. I think if it tapered in at the bottom just a smidge, you could still get the loose top effect while looking slimmer.
